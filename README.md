# Fave-Tracker-Angular-App

My final project for Seneca's WEB422. The Angular app fetches real data from Spotiy's Web API and 
allows registered users to search and save their favourite tracks. The user data is stored in a MongoDB 
collection via a JWT User-API I also made. The Angular app then uses route guards, http interceptors 
and localstorage to ensure restricted access.
