# Fave-Tracker-Angular-App

My final project for Seneca's WEB422. The Angular app fetches real data from Spotiy's Web API and 
allows registered users to search for and save their favourite tracks. The user data is stored in a MongoDB 
collection via a JWT User-API I also made. The Angular app then uses route guards, http interceptors 
and localstorage to ensure restricted access. 

    Please note: the actual repo for this project is private for security reasons. 
    Here is a view of my source code without environment variables.
